# Shadowrocket \[M1 Macs ONLY]

Updated: April 17, 2024

{% hint style="danger" %}
Shadowrocket is a third-party paid app. If you already have a non-chinese itunes account, we recommend using [OneClick](../oneclick-m1-macs-only-recommended.md) instead. OneClick's setup is easier as well.
{% endhint %}

Shadowrocket is now working on all M-series Macs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have an M1 Mac, please use [ClashX](clashx-v1.30.1-and-higher.md) instead.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Download the app

The Shadowrocket app has been taken down from the Chinese app store. Use our US iTunes account to download it.

{% hint style="info" %}
To find the login and password for our US iTunes account, login to your [client area](https://wannaflix.com/clientarea.php), select Shadowrocket under "Mac Setup", click "Download", and you'll see our iTunes account login details there.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**See our** [**detailed guide on how to login to our iTunes account.**](../../ios/switching-itunes-account.md)
{% endhint %}

Open your Mac App Store. Search for "shadowrocket", and click the iPad/iPhone apps tab to find it. Download it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT:** make sure you remember your own iTunes account username and password so you can log back into your account after downloading the app.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If all our accounts don't work because the password needs to be reset, please send a message on our telegram group or open a support ticket (see your client area under "Support").
{% endhint %}
