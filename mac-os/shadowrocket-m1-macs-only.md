# Shadowrocket (M1 Macs ONLY) (Recommended)

Updated: December 11, 2021

Shadowrocket is now working on all M1 Macs. If you have an M1 Mac and would like to use Shadowrocket on it, please refer to our iOS installation guide [here](../../ios/v2ray-shadowsocks/shadowrocket.md).

{% hint style="success" %}
Shadowrocket now support the new VLESS+XTLS protocol. We HIGHLY recommend updating your APIs to the latest version 3.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have an M1 Mac, please use [ClashX](clashx-v1.30.1-and-higher.md#troubleshooting) instead. V2rayU is not as stable.
{% endhint %}
