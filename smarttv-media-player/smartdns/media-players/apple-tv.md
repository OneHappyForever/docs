## Access the Streaming Apps

### **Apple TV (Gen 2 and 3)**

If you would like to have US apps (like Netflix and Hulu), change your iTunes Store location by navigating to "Settings" and scrolling down to "iTunes Store" and selecting your location as "United States" (you don't need a US iTunes account, you just need to select the US as your location).

Restart your Apple TV again and once it has rebooted, the streaming apps will be shown on the main screen.

### **Apple TV (Gen 4)**

You need to create a free iTunes account for each country you wish to download apps for (e.g. a US iTunes account is required to download US-only apps, a UK iTunes account is required to download UK-only apps). This is the same as how other iOS devices (e.g. iPhone, iPad) work, instructions for creating free iTunes accounts can be found on our [iOS setup page](https://www.getflix.com.au/setup/ios#download\_apps). If you havn't already signed up for Netflix or Hulu, do it from a PC browser rather than via the Apple TV app. Using the Apple TV app requires a US iTunes account attached to a US issued credit card.
