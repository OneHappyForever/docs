4\. Fill out the form and make sure to set USA as country - choose a US zip code like 90210

5\. Go on and upgrade to Xbox Live Gold

6\. When filling out the info make sure to use a fake US address. Use zip code 90210, Beverly Hills, California or something of that nature.

7\. Now you can login with your new Xbox Live Gold account on your Xbox and install US only apps.

You can also use a real US address. Look up the address of a hotel or shopping center. It does not require an Xbox Live Gold account.
