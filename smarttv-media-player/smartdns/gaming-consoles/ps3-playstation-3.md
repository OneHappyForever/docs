**IMPORTANT:** In order to install US apps on your PS3 you need a US PSN account. Follow the steps below to set it up.
{% endhint %}

## Get a US PSN account and install Netflix

Netflix \(and other streaming apps\) are only available on the US PSN store, and so to get access to those you will need to create a US PSN account. Once created and once the apps are downloaded and installed, they will appear within your primary PSN account, so the US PSN account is just a temporary one so the apps can be downloaded.  


### **Create a New User**

Start by creating a new user on the PS3. You can choose whatever name you want, it doesn't have to match your PSN name. After you create the user, click on the newly created user icon and log in as the new user.

### **Create a New PSN Account**

Next, make your way to the PlayStation Network section, and select the Sign Up link. In the screen that opens, choose to create a new account.

In the next screen, make sure you select United States as your country, the other entries can be filled in any way you like.

Next, enter you email address and a suitable password.

Next, enter an online ID - this doesn't have to be the same as your PS3 account username.

Next, fill in a US address. You can create a fake one and use a valid ZIP code, however, it's advisable to use a real US address. Look up the address of a hotel or shopping center.

Continue on through the steps until your new PSN account is created.

Alternatively, simply go to [http://us.playstation.com/psn/](http://us.playstation.com/psn/) and create a US PSN account. Once done use the US account with the Playstation store and search for the apps and install the app. From then on you are good to go.

Please note that if you have already have the us application installed you might need to reset settings in the app. This is done by holding down _Start_ and _Select_ while opening the app. 
{% endhint %}

### **Download and Install the Streaming Apps**
