# PS4 (Playstation 4)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Netflix has upgraded its geo-blocking recently and may not work with our SmartDNS on PS4 devices. Blocking public DNS server MAY solve the issue.&#x20;

See how to block public DNS servers [here](../../../routers/smartdns/block-public-dns.md).

Hulu, etc. still work.

1. Login to your client area ([https://wannaflix.com/clientarea.php](https://wannaflix.com/clientarea.php))
2. Click on your active SmartDNS subscription

### Please note:

In order to install US Apps on your PS4 you need a US PSN account. Simply go to [http://us.playstation.com/psn/](http://us.playstation.com/psn/) and create a US PSN account. Once done use the US account with the Playstation store and search for the app and install it. From then on you are good to go.

Please note that if you already have the US application installed you might need to reset settings in the app. This is done by holding down _Start_ and _Select_ while opening the app.
