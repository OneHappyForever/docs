# Installation Issues

## Windows

### A**nti-virus prevents the app f**r**om installing**

1. Remove the all traces of the app from your computer.
2. Re-download the app again from our website
3. Pause the antivirus software \(recommended for 1 hour or until reboot\)
4. Install the app
5. Create an exception for the app in your anti-virus software

## Android

### Phone doesn't allow apps from "Unknown Sources"

This is because you downloaded the app directly from our website instead of using the Google Play store. Do the following to eliminate this error:

2. Check the option "Unknown sources".
3. Tap OK on the prompt message.
4. Select "Trust".

Thatâ€™s all, now you can install the app.

## Mac

2. Choose **Open**
