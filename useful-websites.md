## YouTube adblock

#### iOS

Usually most people can block Youtube ads on PC/Mac, but have a hard time doing it on iOS.&#x20;

Option #1: Brave Browser. Open YouTube in Brave. It blocks all the ads. They also have option to load popular adblocks.&#x20;

Option #2: [Vinegar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vinegar-tube-cleaner/id1591303229). It's a Safari plugin. The app costs $2. It replaces the default Youtube player with the generic HTML player, and blocks Youtube ads. You can select the video quality to load (bypasses Youtube's default 360p quality on mobile).

How does it work?

        We use state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms by Google, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA AI. When you encounter a CAPTCHA challenge, it is solved on our GPU server farm, and our active learning pipeline automatically and continuously improves the AI.
        Simply put, as more users use our extension, our AI gets better at solving CAPTCHAs. When new CAPTCHA types are added, our AI learns to solve them in real-time!
```
{% endcode %}

In other words, it uploads the captcha data to their servers and the captcha is solved remotely. The answer is then sent back to your browser extension. It does not use your CPU or GPU, but does send some data to the cloud.
