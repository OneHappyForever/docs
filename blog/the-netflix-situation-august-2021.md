# The Netflix Situation - August 2021

### TL;DR \(aka. short version\)

Netflix has updated it's algorithm. Most regions can no longer unblock Netflix reliably. We believe we will be able to unblock US, Japan, and Hong Kong regions going forward without too much difficulty. As for the other regions, we will continue to try to keep them unblocked, but we cannot provide any guarantees at this time.

NOTE: This does not affect any other streaming services like Hulu, Disney+, etc.

### Long version:

On August 4, 2021, Netflix drastically changed its VPN detection algorithm. Most VPNs were no longer able to unblock Netflix, including the largest ones such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN. This new update was so extreme that some users who were not using VPNs in the US had their home IPs blocked by Netflix. 

Clearly, this was a change in Netflix's blocking strategy. Why did Netflix make this change? And how will it affect Netflix-unblocking services in the future, including WannaFlix? Let us see.

### Why Netflix blocks VPNs

To understand how the latest round of blocking will affect us, we need to understand the reasons behind it. 

Netflix itself actually does not want to block VPNs. In fact, even when Netflix identifies a connection as coming from a VPN server, it still allows you to watch shows it has produced in-house. After all, it doesn't cost anything to let you watch them, and Netflix can keep you on its platform.

The problem appears when Netflix has to buy the rights to offer movies and tv shows owned by other companies, like Disney, Universal Pictures, etc. Usually these companies only give Netflix the rights to show their content to some countries, and they put pressure on Netflix to block access to customers who don't live in those countries \(aka, those using VPNs\).

Bottom line: Netflix wasn't trying very hard to block VPNs before. But it seems the networks have increased their pressure and Netflix had to update it's algorithm as a result.
