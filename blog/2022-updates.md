A new year has started, and with it new updates.&#x20;

In this post, we will be going over some common issues and how to fix them, new updates that you may have missed, and what we are planing in the weeks ahead.

## How to resolve recent issues

### My router has stopped working since January 1, 2022

This issue affects Merlin routers only. This is happening because your v2ray app is out of date. To fix it, please follow the steps on [this page](../routers/merlin/v2ray.md#update-important) (basically, update your firmware, and install a new version of the v2ray app).
