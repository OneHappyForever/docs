# 2022 Updates

A new year has started, and with it comes new updates!&#x20;

In this post, we will be going over some common issues and how to fix them, new updates that you may have missed, and what we are planing in the weeks ahead.

We've got a lot of updates so we'll try to keep them short, simple, and to the point.&#x20;

All right! Let's get started.

## How to resolve recent issues

### My router has stopped working since January 1, 2022

This issue affects Merlin routers only. This is happening because your v2ray app is out of date. To fix it, please follow the steps on [this page](../routers/merlin/v2ray.md#update-important) (basically, update your firmware, and install a new version of the v2ray app).

### Clash servers are not very stable

Around December 25, 2021, Vmess servers (old protocol) got blocked quite severly. This only affected the old protocol, so moving the new protocol will fix this issue. Clash cannot run the new protocol (VLESS+XTLS), so you'll need to switch to another app if you want to use the new protocol.&#x20;

We know many users still prefer Clash despite its shortcomings, so we've implemented a new way of bypassing blockings which is currently effective even for the old protocol. However, it only works with servers labelled CHINA. Normal servers may still be blocked from time to time on Clash.

TL;DR: Switch to the new protocol or use CHINA servers on Clash.

## New updates

### A new status page

In case you missed it, we now have a status page that shows the streaming unblocking status of our servers in real time. See the [status page here](https://status.wannaflix.net).

### Telegram proxy

You can add our Telegram proxy to your telegram app. This way, you'll still have access to our Telegram group even when the VPN doesn't work. [Add it here.](https://wannaflix.net/telegram-proxy.php)

### Check your IP tool

You can now check your IP location on this page to make sure that you are indeed connected to our servers. [Click here to access the tool.](https://wannaflix.net/testip.php)

### Free seedbox

We only allow torrenting on servers marked "torrenting". However, you can use a seedbox and download the files via normal servers. We know seedboxes cost money, so we provide a free shared seedbox for those who want it. Access it [here](https://wannaflix.net/torrenting.php).

### Shadowrocket on M1 Macs

In case you have an M1 Mac, you can now install Shadowrocket on your Mac from the App Store. Just search for Shadowrocket under "iOS Apps". If you have an M1 Mac, we highly recommend using Shadowrocket as it's stable and supports the latest protocol.

### Telegram group

This is more of a reminder for those who may be new to the service, but in case you didn't know, we have a group chat on Telegram! You can ask us questions, ask for help, and chat with hundreds of users just like you.&#x20;

Also, we regularly post updates in the "pinned" messages at the top of the chat. You can stay updated with the latest news that way (especially if you're in China).

We highly recommend all to join the group!

## Future plans

### Get the VIP servers on the new protocol

We're planing on adding VLESS+XLTS support for VIP servers within the next few weeks.

### Send us your ideas

We've already implemented most of what we wanted to do. If you have an idea on how to make the service better, please send us a message on our [telegram group](https://t.me/wannaflixvpn) (begin the message with \[NEW SUGGESTION]).
