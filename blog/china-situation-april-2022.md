# China Situation - April 2022

Before we start, the entire WannaFlix team would like to express our appreciation for your patience and understanding thoughout the past few weeks.&#x20;

Here at WannaFlix, we value transparency and feel it is your right to know what is going on with the ever-evolving internet situation in China. This will help you understand potential issues that may come up, and changes that we are taking to adapt.

## How WannaFlix keeps your internet fast and secure

First, we need to understand how WannaFlix tunnels your connection out of China.

There are 2 main ways.&#x20;

First, we can encrypt your connection, then wrap it in a TLS layer to make it appear like normal web traffic, and send all of this directly to a server abroad. This is what we do for non-CHINA labeled servers. The protocol is secure and the servers don't get blocked. However, directly connecting to the end servers abroad can be slow.

So the second way is to do the exact same thing, except we first send the traffic to a middle server in China, which has good peering to our end servers abroad. Nothing is decrypted in China so your traffic remains private. But now we also have a fast internet.&#x20;

In previous years, it was our servers abroad that were vulnerable to getting blocked. However, with current protocols, we can effectively evade this kind of censorship. Therefore, it is not a protocol problem.&#x20;

What has been affecting us these past few weeks is blocking of our middle servers in China. &#x20;
