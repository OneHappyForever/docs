# What's new in January 2021?

Well, it looks like the December blog has been well received.

What's new in January 2021?

## New Middle Servers

Our old middle server lost it's good international routing so we had to search for alternatives. 

We now have 4 routes:

China Unicom 1: Germany 1, UK 1, Russia, India, SSR Germany, SSR UK

China Unicom 2: Japan 1, Taiwan, Hong Kong 2, US 2, Germany 2

China Mobile 1: STREAMING, New York, Canada, Hong Kong 1, Japan 2, Korea, Singapore, Netherlands, SSR Hong Kong, SSR Singapore, SSR Japan, SSR US

China Mobile 2: All Eclipse servers

## New Alipay Gateway

We have finally found a new Alipay gateway that also works with non-Chinese accounts so now everyone can use Alipay.

Seems like that will make things easier for a lot of people. :\)

## New Bank Transfer Gateway 

We have partnered with [Trustly ](https://www.trustly.net/)to provide a secure, easy bank transfer option for those with UK or EU bank accounts \(including Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, etc.\).

It's almost as easy as paying with your card.

## USDT Cryptocurrency Gateway

Advantages over bitcoin:

* No transfer fees
* No markup by the payment gateway
* Shorter transfer wait time \(5 minutes vs up to 1 hour for bitcoin\)
* Price does not fluctuate \(the price is pegged to the US Dollar 1:1, so no surprises with volatility\)

To purchase Tether \(USDT\), you can use Binance. Register on Binance, link your Visa/Mastercard, and purchase the required amount of Tether. Then, withdraw the Tether \(USDT\) to our address on our payment gateway.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure to select the TRON blockchain when withdrawing \(USDT-**TRC20**\) as withdrawing on another blockchain will result in irrecoverable loss of funds.

Binance supports the TRON blockchain, but not all exchanges do.
{% endhint %}
