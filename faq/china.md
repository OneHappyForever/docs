# China

## Does Wannaflix work in China?

Yes. We use special software and protocols to bypass the China's blocking. Our service is fast, stable, and resistant to crack-downs.

## What is the typical speed I can expect from Wannaflix in China?

Our fastest servers are those labeled "\[CHINA\]". You can expect 60-80 Mbps on a 100 Mbps connection on those servers.

European and US servers are slower due to the nature of the undersea cable network. You can expect 50-70 Mbps on our optimized US servers and 40-60 Mbps on our European servers \(depending on which country you choose to connect to\). 

## Will you get blocked?

We've been doing this for over 5 years and we know how the government blocks VPNs. We have never been fully blocked, although it has meant changing the way we do things a couple times.

Hundreds of expats like you rely on us to provide a consistent working solution, and they haven't been disappointed. You won't either.
