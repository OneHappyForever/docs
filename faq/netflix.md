## Will your service continue to unblock these regions in the future?

We are confident in our ability to bypass Netflix's attempts at geo-blocking. We've been doing this for 5 years now and we know the mechanisms Netflix uses and how to bypass them effectively. 

We will continue to unblock US, UK, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Germany regions.Other regions are subject to change depending on demand. 

## What if I want to unblock a region that is not on the list?

Open a ticket with us and we'll see what we can do. We're always looking to expand our network.

## Why do you have servers in X country if it doesn't unblock Netflix?

Not all our users are interested in watching Netflix. We also have a significant portion who use Wannaflix to bypass government internet restrictions. We also set up servers for them, which may not always unblock Netflix. Only servers labelled "Netflix" can unblock Netflix.
