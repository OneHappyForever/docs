## WANNAFLIX BASICS

### What is WannaFlix?

WannaFlix is your gateway to a free, fast, and unrestricted internet. The way the internet should be.

Connecting to WannaFlix gives you access to different Netflix regions, bypasses local restrictions and firewalls, and protects your data from third parties.

We do this by encrypting your data and rerouting it through our servers using protocols such as v2ray, Shadowsocks, Eclipse, and SmartDNS.

### Will Wannaflix slow my internet connection?

This is possible with any VPN, but the difference is often unnoticeable. Furthermore, if your internet service provider is throttling certain types of traffic, using a VPN could actually boost your speed. WannaFlix runs a premium high-speed network using bandwidth from Tier-1 providers and direct peering with Chinese ISPs \(data is always encrypted until in reaches our servers **outside** China\).

### Why doesn’t my WannaFlix desktop app automatically update? 

Unlike the mobile versions, the desktop apps don't automatically update.

You'll need to download the latest version from our website to update.

### Why doesn’t my WannaFlix app notify me that a new version is available? 

Some apps do \(like Netch and Clash for Windows\). However, if you do not receive any notifications, please check the guide page for the latest versions.

### What is the Speed Test/Ping Test? 

Some apps have a Speed Test / Ping Test function. This is designed to find the best server for you. However, each app tests the connection in slightly different ways.

The tests don't provide a complete picture and are unreliable at best.

We do not recommend using these tests. Instead, choose 2-3 servers, connect to them, and then go to [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) in your browser to test the connection.

No, WannaFlix does not, and will never, throttle your connection.
