# Support

## How can I contact the support team?

[Open a support ticket](https://wannaflix.com/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=1) describing your issue in detail. 

Please include the following:

* Your OS & OS version \(i.e. Windows 10/Mac OS Sierra\)
* The app you are using 
* Which server you are trying to connect to
* Any error messages you received

## How long does it usually take for the team to answer?

We answer all questions within 24 hours

## Why do you do tickets instead of a live chat?

We find that tickets allows us to give more thorough answers. We can ask other members of the team and do additional research if needed.

If you need quick answers, we recommend doing a search here, in our documentation, or **joining our telegram group chat.**\([https://t.me/wannaflixvpn](https://t.me/wannaflixvpn)\)
