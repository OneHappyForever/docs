# Whatsapp

Whatsapp text and pictures usually work fine. However, some users have encountered issues with Whatsapp calls not connecting in China. Here are the updated fixes.

## iOS

### Shadowrocket

Disable UDP forwarding in Shadowrocket settings. Open Shadowrocket > Settings > UDP > Disable UDP (set the switch to off).

## Android

### v2rayNG

V2rayNG works with Whatsapp calls by default. If other apps don't work, consider switching to this app for your Whatsapp calls.
