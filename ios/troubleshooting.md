# Troubleshooting

## V2ray servers don't show

Either the Shadowrocket app is outdated, or you are using an old API link. 

1. Open the App Store and update Shadowrocket 

   In case you need the iTunes login details:

             login: ultravpns.com@gmail.com

             password: tgnotKwbp0

2. If it still fails, login to your client area and get the new API link there
