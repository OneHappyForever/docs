# Switching iTunes Accounts

You may need to use our US iTunes account for some iOS apps. If so, you'll need to log out from your App Store account and log into ours. Once done, you'll need to log back into your own iTunes account.

Here is how to do it.

## Watch Tutorial Video:

We highly recommend watching the video tutorial. You can stream it in China too.

## Logging in to our iTunes account

#### 1. Open your App Store on your iOS device

Do **NOT** go to your Settings app. You must go to the App Store to log out.
{% endhint %}

#### 2. Navigate to the "Today" view&#x20;

&#x20;    It's the tab on the bottom left corner.

#### 3. Click on the head icon on the top right corner of the screen

&#x20;    A new pop up window will appear.&#x20;

#### 4. Scroll to the bottom of the new window and click "Sign Out"

#### 5. Close the window

#### 6. Click on the head icon on the top right corner of the screen again to re-open the window

#### 7. Use our iTunes account login details to sign in

&#x20;    You can find our iTunes account details in your client area dashboard, under iOS Setup > Shadowrocket > Download

#### 8. If a "Apple ID Security" popup appears, click on "other options" at the bottom. A new window will appear. Select "Do not upgrade".

Congratulations! You're now logged in. You can now use the new ID to download our recommended apps.&#x20;

## Logging back into your own iTunes account

Simply repeat the steps above, substituting our iTunes account details for your own.
