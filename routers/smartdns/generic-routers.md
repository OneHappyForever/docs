## Setting up the DNS on you router

1. Connect to the router via your browser. Common addresses are [http://10.0.1.1](http://10.0.1.1/), [http://192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1/), [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1/),  [http://192.168.2](http://192.168.2.1/) [.1](http://192.168.2.1/), [http://192.168.50.1](http://192.168.50.1), [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1)
2. Log in to the router. Common user names are: _admin_, _root_, _default_ and common passwords are _admin_,_1234_, _default_, _password_ \(you can usually find the username and password on the router\)
3. Find network settings and change the DNS to  **165.227.243.239** and **165.227.254.128** \(if there is only 1 slot, just enter the first one\)
4. Apply the changes by saving settings.
5. Restart devices connected to the router.

If you are unable to configure your router then simply configure your device instead. The result is the same.
