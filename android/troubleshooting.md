# Troubleshooting

## Phone doesn't allow apps from "Unknown Sources"

This is because you downloaded the app directly from our website instead of using the Google Play store. Do the following to eliminate this error:

1. Navigate to Setting &gt; Security.
2. Check the option "Unknown sources".
3. Tap OK on the prompt message.
4. Select "Trust".

Thatâ€™s all, now you can install the app.
