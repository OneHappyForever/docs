&#x20;      3\. Select "Turn V2ray-core On" (shortcut: command + T)

_YOU ARE NOW CONNECTED_

## Troubleshooting

#### http error - listen tcp 127.0.0.1:1087: bind: address already in use

This is because the port 1087 is already taken by another program on your Mac. You need to go to V2rayU's settings and change the default port it uses to another one.

1. Go to Preferences > Advanced
2. Change the Local Http Listen Port to something else (for example, 1080)
3. Click "save settings"

## Troubleshooting

### The app suddenly stopped working. I can't connect to any servers.

It is possible you are on an older version of v2rayU. Please download the latest version from your client area or from [this link](https://github.com/yanue/V2rayU/releases), and replace your old version with the new one.
