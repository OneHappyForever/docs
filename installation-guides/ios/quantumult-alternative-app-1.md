Updated: March 17, 2021

{% hint style="danger" %}
This app is deprecated as it does not support the latest protocols.&#x20;

Please upgrade to [Shadowrocket](../../ios/shadowrocket.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE: We only officially support [Shadowrocket](../../ios/shadowrocket.md).

However, as some users prefer Quantumult, we've written a tutorial on how to use WannaFlix with it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Quantumult has not been updated for over 1 year.

The newer QuantumultX app does **NOT** support v2ray.
{% endhint %}

## Install the App

The Quantumult app has been taken down from the Chinese app store. Use our iTunes account to download it:

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;find the login and password for our US iTunes account, login to your [client area](https://wannaflix.com/clientarea.php), click iOS, and you'll see our iTunes account login details there.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
See our [detailed guide on how to login to our iTunes account.](../../ios/switching-itunes-account.md)
{% endhint %}

Search for "quantumult" and download it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
IMPORTANT: make sure you remember your own iTunes account username and password so you can log back into your account after downloading the app.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If the main account doesn't work, please try our secondary account.&#x20;

You can get our secondary account from your client area dashboard (iOS > V2ray).
